                         Software Installation

Purpose

    This document defines the policy on installation of software
    through various purposes.



General policy

    1. /Never/ install non-free packages or packages which require
       or contain non-free packages or blobs.
    2. Always prefer using APT over compiling from source.



APT
    1. Always prefer Debian repositories over custom repositories like
       Ubuntu Launchpad. You should not add a custom repository without
       a good reason.
    2. Prefer debian/wheezy (stable) over debian/jessie (testing).
    3. Do not use debian/sid (unstable) or experimental without a very
       good reason.
    4. When using a repository other than debian/wheezy or
       debian/jessie it is your responsibility to stay informed of
       CVE's, security advisories and updates through whatever means
       and to apply patches in a timely manner.
    5. When using custom repositories, debian/sid or experimental, any
       dependencies should first follow the policy of points 1 through
       4. For instance, when installing a package from debian/sid you
       should first look to resolve dependencies from debian/wheezy,
       then debian/jessie, then debian/sid.
    6. You should never use apt-get to install packages, use aptitude
       instead.



Compiling from source
    1. When compiling a package from source, ideally use
      `apt-get source` to get the source package, then use the dpkg
       tools to construct a deb binary to install. For this procedure
       the policy under APT applies.
    2. When making changes to the source code of a package you should
       change the version number to reflect this. The format for this
       is `%packagename%-%originalversion%%yourusername%%revision%`,
       e.g., for apache2: `apache2-2.4.6-3argure1`.
    3. The source code and any deb binaries should remain in
       `/usr/local/src`.
    4. When compiling from source without using APT, prefer LTS over
       current-stable; prefer current-stable over current-unstable;
       prefer current-unstable over anything else like nightly builds
       or GIT head.
