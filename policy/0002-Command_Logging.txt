                            Command Logging

Purpose

    This document defines the policy on what commands to log and in
    which format.



General policy

    1. You should log commands that change the behaviour of the system.
       E.g., you should log when installing packages, but there is no
       need to log every `ls` or `cd`.
    2. Log commands in a file LOG.txt found in the `doc/` directory of
       the system you are working on.
    3. Prefix your commands with a header containing
       `%date% %username%`.
    4. Keep logging concise. For instance, when installing packages,
       you should log which packages are changed, but there is no need
       to log the full output of aptitude.
