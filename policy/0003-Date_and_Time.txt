                            Date and Time

Purpose

    This document defines the policy on which date and time notation to
    use in documentation, configuration and code.



General policy

    1. You SHOULD use the ISO 8601 "Data elements and interchange
       formats - Information Exchange - Representation of dates and
       times" as a reference.
    2. Full date and time notation SHOULD be in the syntax of:
       %Y-%m-%dT%l:%M:%S%z
    3. Date-only notation SHOULD include the year and be in the syntax
       of: %Y-%m-%d
    4. Time-only notation SHOULD include (at least) the hour, minutes
       and seconds and MAY include the timezone and be in the syntax
       of: %l:%M:%S or %l:%M:%S%z
    5. Time relative to epoch (e.g., "x minutes ago") is optional and
       MAY be the default in addition to the ISO 8601 notation. It MUST
       NOT replace the ISO 8601 notation.
